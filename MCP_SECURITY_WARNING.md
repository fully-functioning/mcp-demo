# ⚠️ SECURITY WARNING: MCP Server Risks

## CRITICAL: Only Add Trusted MCP Servers

**MCP servers execute with your full user permissions and can access your entire system.** Adding untrusted MCP servers poses significant security risks to your data, privacy, and system integrity.

## Potential Risks of Untrusted MCP Servers

### 🔓 **Full System Access**
- **File System Access**: Can read, modify, or delete any file you have access to
- **Network Access**: Can make outbound connections, potentially exfiltrating your data
- **Process Execution**: Can run arbitrary commands and programs on your system
- **Environment Variables**: Can access sensitive credentials and API keys

### 💾 **Data Security Threats**
- **Data Theft**: Access to personal files, documents, source code, and sensitive information
- **Credential Harvesting**: Can steal API keys, passwords, and authentication tokens
- **Privacy Violation**: Can monitor your activity and access private communications
- **Intellectual Property**: Can copy proprietary code, business documents, and confidential data

### 🦠 **System Compromise**
- **Malware Installation**: Can download and execute malicious software
- **Backdoor Creation**: Can establish persistent access to your system
- **System Modification**: Can alter system configurations and security settings
- **Resource Abuse**: Can use your system for cryptocurrency mining or other unauthorized activities

### 🌐 **Network and Remote Risks**
- **Data Exfiltration**: Can send your files and data to remote servers
- **Remote Code Execution**: Can execute commands received from external sources
- **Man-in-the-Middle**: Can intercept and modify network communications
- **Botnet Participation**: Can make your system part of a malicious network

## Before Adding Any MCP Server

### ✅ **Verification Checklist**
- [ ] **Source Verification**: Only use servers from trusted, verified sources
- [ ] **Code Review**: Examine the server's source code if available
- [ ] **Community Validation**: Check for community reviews and security audits
- [ ] **Official Sources**: Prefer servers from official repositories and known developers
- [ ] **Recent Updates**: Ensure the server is actively maintained and updated

### 🔍 **Red Flags to Avoid**
- ❌ Servers from unknown or suspicious sources
- ❌ Servers requesting unnecessary permissions
- ❌ Closed-source servers without transparency
- ❌ Servers with poor documentation or unclear functionality
- ❌ Servers found on unofficial repositories or forums

### 🛡️ **Security Best Practices**
- **Principle of Least Privilege**: Only grant necessary permissions
- **Regular Audits**: Periodically review and remove unused servers
- **Network Monitoring**: Monitor unusual network activity
- **Backup Strategy**: Maintain secure backups of important data
- **Environment Isolation**: Consider using containerization or virtual machines

## Enterprise and Business Users

### 🏢 **Additional Considerations**
- **Compliance Requirements**: May violate data protection regulations (GDPR, HIPAA, etc.)
- **Corporate Policies**: May conflict with organizational security policies
- **Intellectual Property**: Risk of exposing proprietary information
- **Audit Trails**: MCP servers may not provide adequate logging for compliance

### 📋 **Recommended Actions**
- Obtain security team approval before adding any MCP servers
- Implement network segmentation and monitoring
- Use dedicated development environments for testing
- Establish clear policies for MCP server usage

## Emergency Response

### 🚨 **If You Suspect Compromise**
1. **Immediately disconnect** the system from the network
2. **Stop all MCP servers** and remove suspicious ones
3. **Change all credentials** (passwords, API keys, tokens)
4. **Scan for malware** using updated security tools
5. **Review system logs** for unauthorized activities
6. **Contact security professionals** if needed

## Remember

> **MCP servers are powerful tools that operate with your full system privileges. Treat them with the same caution you would give to any software with administrative access to your computer.**

**When in doubt, don't install.** The convenience of an MCP server is never worth compromising your security, privacy, or data integrity.
